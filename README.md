To use this connector:
1. Setup:
    - Save both files in a web server (can be local for testing)
    - Make sure the web server supports HTTPS (required for Tableau)
    - You might need to adjust CORS settings depending on your API
2. In Tableau Desktop:
Go to Connect → To a Server → Web Data Connector
Enter the URL of your connector.html file
    - Fill in the form with your OAuth credentials
    - Click "Get Data"
3. Important Notes:
    - Adjust the schema in getSchema to match your API's data structure
    - Modify the data processing in getData to match your API's response format
    - Consider adding error handling and validation
    - For production use, you should add proper security measures
    - The token handling could be enhanced to include refresh tokens if needed
4. Security Considerations:
    - Store sensitive credentials securely
    - Consider implementing server-side token management
    - Add proper error handling and logging
    - Implement rate limiting if needed

Remember to replace the placeholder schema and data processing with your actual API's structure and requirements.
